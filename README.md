# kv6
A rust crate to allow easy reading of multiple Ken Silverman voxel formats. Currently the only format supported is `kv6` but `kvx` is planned.

## What is the KV6 format?
KV6 is the Voxel sprite format used by Voxlap and Evaldraw which was made by [Ken Silverman](http://advsys.net/ken/) back in 2000.

## Examples
The [examples directory](./examples/) has a couple of examples to show you how to read/write kv6 files
